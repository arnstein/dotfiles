Dotfiles
======


Here are my dotfiles, which shouldn't be interesting to anyone else. In fact, I find it suspicious if you indeed are interested in them!
With this backup of my dotfiles I should be able to get myself set up on a new computer fairly fast.
This will (hopefully) get me a nice i3 setup with Polybar and the solarized light theme.

### Packages

I intend to make a list of the packages and dependencies that I use so they are easily installable in the install_packages.sh. This will most likely never be up to date, but should still ease the fresh install process.
